Component Tree:
The component tree of the Kanban board solution in React would consist of the following components:

KanbanBoard (Parent Component): This component serves as the highest level component and represents the Kanban board itself. It holds the state for the tasks and manages their statuses. It is responsible for rendering the columns representing each status (e.g., TODO, IN PROGRESS, DONE) and passing the necessary props to child components.

Column: This component represents a column on the Kanban board, corresponding to a specific task status (e.g., TODO, IN PROGRESS, DONE). It receives the tasks belonging to that status and renders them as TaskItems.

TaskItem: This component represents an individual task on the Kanban board. It receives the task details as props and displays them.

Hooks Usage:
In the new solution, we would use the following hooks:

useState: KanbanBoard component would use useState to manage the state of tasks and their statuses.

useEffect: KanbanBoard component would use useEffect to make server calls asynchronously when a task's status changes. It would trigger the necessary updates to reflect the changes on the Kanban board.

useDispatch and useSelector (from Redux): These hooks would be used to connect the components to the global state management system (e.g., Redux). KanbanBoard component would use useSelector to retrieve the necessary data (e.g., tasks) from the store, and useDispatch to dispatch actions for updating the state.

useCallback: This hook would be used to memoize callback functions and prevent unnecessary re-renders.

Styling Library:
The choice of styling library is subjective and depends on personal preference and project requirements. Some popular options for styling in React are:

styled-components: It allows writing CSS within JavaScript using tagged template literals. It offers component-based styling and supports dynamic styling based on props.

CSS Modules: It enables local scoping of CSS classes by generating unique class names for each component. It provides a way to import and use CSS classes in JavaScript modules.

Tailwind CSS: It is a utility-first CSS framework that provides pre-defined classes for styling components. It offers a wide range of utility classes, making it easy to style components without writing custom CSS.

File Structure:
The file structure of the new solution could be organized as follows:

src/
components/ : This folder contains all the React components used in the application, such as KanbanBoard, Column, and TaskItem.

containers/ : This folder contains container components that connect the UI components to the global state management system (e.g., Redux). For example, the KanbanBoardContainer component would handle the interaction with Redux and pass the necessary props to the KanbanBoard component.

services/ : This folder contains the files responsible for making server calls and managing data related to tasks. For example, the TaskService.js file would contain methods for fetching tasks, updating task statuses, and handling async operations.

store/ : This folder contains files related to the Redux store configuration, such as actions, reducers, and the store itself.

styles/ : This folder contains global styles, CSS files, or theme-related files used across the application.

App.js : The entry point of the application, where the top-level components are rendered.

index.js : The file responsible for rendering the root component (e.g., App) into the DOM.

By organizing the project into these folders, we can maintain a clear separation of concerns and improve the maintainability of the codebase.
